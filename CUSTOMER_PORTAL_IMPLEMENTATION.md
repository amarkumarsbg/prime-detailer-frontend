# Customer Portal - Implementation Complete ✅

**Status:** Frontend 100% Complete | Backend Implementation Guide Ready 📋

---

## Quick Start for Backend Developer

### 1. Read the Backend Implementation Guide
👉 **[CUSTOMER_PORTAL_BACKEND.md](./CUSTOMER_PORTAL_BACKEND.md)** - Complete specs for all required endpoints

### 2. Key Endpoints to Implement (Priority Order)

```
🔴 CRITICAL (Blocking Portal):
  POST /api/auth/customer/login         → Return JWT + customer user profile
  GET /api/auth/customer/me             → Validate session
  GET /api/customer/bootstrap           → Load all dashboard data at once

🟡 HIGH (Core Features):
  GET /api/customer/job-cards           → Customer's job cards
  GET /api/customer/invoices            → Customer's invoices with payments array
  GET /api/customer/vehicles            → Customer's vehicles
  GET /api/customer/memberships         → Customer's memberships (with packageName)

🟢 MEDIUM (Future Pages):
  GET /api/customer/service-history     → Completed jobs
  GET /api/customer/rewards             → Points + history
  GET /api/customer/wallet              → Balance + transactions
```

### 3. Security: Critical Pattern

Every customer endpoint MUST:
1. Extract `customerId` from JWT token (never from frontend)
2. Filter all queries by authenticated customer's ID
3. Reject requests for other customers' data with 403

```typescript
// Example middleware
const customerId = req.user.customerId;  // From JWT
const invoices = await Invoice.find({ customerId });  // Filter by ID
```

### 4. Test Data

Once endpoints are ready, test with:
- **Customer Login:** Phone (10 digits) + Password
- **Data Isolation:** Login as customer A, try accessing customer B's invoice → Should get 403

## What's Waiting for Backend

### Blocking Frontend (Need These to Test Portal)

1. **POST /api/auth/customer/login**
   - Request: `{ phone: string, password: string }`
   - Response: `{ accessToken, user: CustomerUser }`
   - Frontend will: Call this, get JWT, save to store, redirect to /customer/dashboard

2. **GET /api/auth/customer/me**
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
   - Response: `{ user: CustomerUser }`
   - Frontend will: Call on page load to validate session

3. **GET /api/customer/bootstrap**
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
   - Response: All customer data (jobs, invoices, vehicles, memberships, wallet, services)
   - Frontend will: Call once on layout mount, populate dashboard

4. **GET /api/customer/memberships** (with package name join)
   - Frontend will: Display in "More" page

## Design Overview

### 🎨 Visual Layout

**Mobile (Primary):**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Logo  Name  Logout  │  ← Fixed header
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│   Dashboard Cards   │  ← Scrollable content
│   Job Cards, etc    │
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ 🏠 🎯 📄 🚗 ⋯      │  ← Fixed bottom nav (5 items)
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Desktop (Optional):**
- Add sidebar on left (hidden on mobile)
- Same 5 nav items
- Content flows to right

### 🎯 Navigation

1. **Home** → `/customer/dashboard` (overview)
2. **Jobs** → `/customer/jobs` (list)
3. **Invoices** → `/customer/invoices` (billing)
4. **Vehicles** → `/customer/vehicles` (fleet)
5. **More** → `/customer/more` (profile, rewards, wallet, referral, memberships)

### 🔐 Data Flow

```
Customer Login (phone + password)
         ↓
POST /api/auth/customer/login
         ↓
Save JWT Token + Customer Profile
         ↓
Redirect to /customer/dashboard
         ↓
GET /api/customer/bootstrap
         ↓
Load all data (jobs, invoices, vehicles, etc)
         ↓
Render Dashboard + 5 pages (all read-only)
```

## Testing Checklist

Once backend is ready:

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Login with valid phone + password → JWT token + redirect
- [ ] Login with invalid phone → Error message
- [ ] Login with invalid password → Error message
- [ ] Expired token → Redirect to login
- [ ] Missing token → Redirect to login
- [ ] /customer/login when already logged in → Redirect to dashboard

### Data Isolation Tests
- [ ] Login as customer A → See only customer A's data
- [ ] Login as customer B → See only customer B's data
- [ ] Try accessing customer A's data as customer B → 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Change invoice URL ID to another customer → 403 Forbidden

### UI Tests

## Code Examples

### Frontend Calling API

```typescript
// In store or component
const response = await apiGet("/api/customer/bootstrap");
// frontend will:
// 1. Extract JWT from localStorage (stored by customer-auth-store)
// 2. Add: Authorization: Bearer {token}
// 3. Call endpoint
// 4. Parse response and populate store
```

### Expected Invoice Structure

```typescript
{
  id: "inv-123",
  invoiceNumber: "INV/2025/001",
  grandTotal: 5000,
  payments: [
    { id: "p1", amount: 3000, paidAt: "2025-01-10", method: "UPI" },
    { id: "p2", amount: 2000, paidAt: "2025-01-15", method: "CARD" }
  ],
  status: "PAID",
  // ... other fields
}

// Frontend calculates:
// totalPaid = 5000 (sum of payments.amount)
// outstanding = 0 (grandTotal - totalPaid)
```

## WhatsApp Integration

### Message Sent When Customer Created

```
Hi Vijay! 🎉 Welcome to Prime Detailer!

Your booking BK-2025-001 has been confirmed.

Here are your account credentials to track your service:

📱 Phone: 9876543210

```

### Backend Needs To:
1. Generate random 8-char password when creating customer account
2. Save hashed password to database
3. Send plain password in WhatsApp message (only time it's visible)
4. Use template from: `src/lib/customer-credentials-whatsapp.ts`

---

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Rate limiting on login endpoint
- [ ] CORS configured for customer domain
- [ ] WhatsApp integration active
- [ ] Environment variables set (NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, etc)
- [ ] Customer login redirects to portal (not workshop dashboard)
- [ ] Platform owner/staff login still works (routes to /dashboard)
- [ ] SSL certificate valid for customer portal
- [ ] Monitoring/logging for customer API endpoints

## Support Resources

### Documentation
- 📋 [Backend Implementation Guide](./CUSTOMER_PORTAL_BACKEND.md) - Detailed specs for every endpoint
- 📚 [Architecture Reference](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - How portal fits into overall system
- 🏗️ [Folder Structure](./FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md) - Where customer files are organized

### Key Files
- Frontend: `src/app/customer/**` (all portal pages)
- Stores: `src/store/customer-*.ts` (state management)
- Types: `src/types/auth.ts` (CUSTOMER role)
- Utils: `src/lib/customer-credentials-whatsapp.ts` (WhatsApp template)

### Debugging
- Check browser DevTools Network tab for API calls
- Look at customer-auth-store console logs for JWT issues
- Use React DevTools to inspect store state
- Check server logs for 403 authorization failures

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Developer:** Read [CUSTOMER_PORTAL_BACKEND.md](./CUSTOMER_PORTAL_BACKEND.md)
2. **Implement:** Authentication endpoints first (POST /api/auth/customer/login, GET /api/auth/customer/me)
3. **Test:** Login flow with phone + password
4. **Implement:** /api/customer/bootstrap endpoint with all dashboard data
5. **Test:** Data isolation (customer A can't see customer B's data)
6. **Implement:** Remaining endpoints (jobs, invoices, vehicles, memberships)
7. **Test:** All pages load correctly with real data
8. **Deploy:** Frontend + Backend together

**Frontend is complete and waiting. Backend is the critical path to launch.** 🚀
